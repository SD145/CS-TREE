                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

Copr / mock

centos - stream - 8
rename?

The
configuration
for CentOS Stream 8 was renamed in mock-core-configs so
it
makes
more
sense
now(currently
the
updated
package is getting
to
updates - testing), and we &  # 39;ll have to adjust Fedora Copr to comply with
that
layout.

The
idea
now is to
try script the movement on backend (built results), and
create
compat
symlink &  # 39;centos-stream-x86_64 =&gt; centos-stream-8-x86_64&#39;.
This
way
new
build
results
will
be
put
into
the
new
location, and old
clients
will
be
able
to
access
old / new
results.

Does
this
make
sense, or is there
a
better
idea?

From
the
UI / API
perspective, I
believe
we &  # 39;ll be able to migrate the
existing
chroot
transparently
without
disabling
old
one and creating
a
new
one.If
this
doesn &  # 39;t happen to be possible (new chroot will be needed)
I &  # 39;ll reply here to warn you that the centos-stream buildroot needs to be
re - enabled.In
any
case, note
that
the
`--chroot
centos - stream - x86_64
`
option
will
stop
working
very
soon, and you
should
start
using
`--chroot
centos - stream - 8 - x86_64
`.

== Summary ==
Add
the[ < a
href = "https://github.com/juhp/fbrnch"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / juhp / fbrnch < / a > fbrnch] packager
tool
to
Fedora.

== Owner ==
*Name: [[User:Petersen | Jens
Petersen]]
*Email: & lt;
petersen(a)
redhat.com & gt;

== Detailed
Description ==
fbrnch(F(ed)
Branch) is a
tool
designed
to
help
simplify or
semi - automate
workflow
processes
for Fedora Packagers.
    It
    was
    first
    presented
    at & quot;
    Nest
    with Fedora & quot; last year, and has
received
some
favorable
feedback
from users.

It is currently
only
available in a
[ < a
href = "https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/petersen/fbrnch/"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // copr.fedorainfracloud.org / coprs / petersen / fbrnch / < / a > Copr
repo].
This
Change is simply
to
bring
the
package
into
Fedora
itself and
broaden
awareness
about
the
tool.

See
the
Benefit
section
below
for more details about the functionality
that
fbrnch
provides.

== Benefit
to
Fedora ==
fbrnch is a
CLI
tool
for Fedora Packagers, which supports some common
tasks
like:

*merging and building
packages
across
release
branches
*automatic
parallel
builds
of
sets
of
packages in dependency
order in
Koji
sidetags
*srpm, scratch, local
install, and mock
builds
from arbitrary package

branches
*cloning and listing
Fedora
packages
from Pagure

*progressive
Copr
builds
across
chroots
*creating, updating and listing
one &  # 39;s package reviews
*requesting
new
repos and branches, and importing
new
packages
directly
from package reviews

and more.See < a
href = "https://github.com/juhp/fbrnch#readme"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / juhp / fbrnch  # readme</a> for example usage.

== Scope ==
*Proposal
owners:
** Release
fbrnch
with new dependencies on the Haskell Hackage
repository and add
to
Stackage.(Latest
current
version
tagged in
github and built in copr is 0.6
.8.)
** Submit and complete
package
review(s).
** Build
packages.
** Test
fbrnch
package
working
correctly.

developers: N / A(not a
System
Wide
Change)
*Release
engineering: N / A(check
by
Release
Engineering
not needed:
this
just
adds
a
few
new
package(s))
*Policies and guidelines: N / A(not a
System

*Trademark
approval: N / A(not needed for this Change)
*Alignment
with Objectives: N / A

== Upgrade / compatibility
impact ==
N / A(not a
System
Wide
Change)

== How
To
Test ==
fbrnch
has
already
been
tested
quite
bit
over
the
last
6
months.

*dnf
install
fbrnch

The[ < a
href = "https://github.com/juhp/fbrnch#readme"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / juhp / fbrnch
# readme</a> Readme file] contains
examples
of
usage, and & lt;
code & gt;
fbrnch - -help & lt; / code & gt;
provides
help
output.

== User
Experience ==
Fedora
Packagers
who
wish
to
use
fbrnch
will
be
able
to
install
it
without
having
to
add
another
Copr
repo,
and benefit
easily
from the advanced

packaging
workflow
features
provided
by
fbnrch.
The
package
will
get
updated
through
Bodhi and
with more testing, will
gain broader confidence from Packagers.

== Dependencies ==
A few package reviews will need to be completed in time.

== Contingency Plan ==
* Contingency mechanism: (What to do?  Who will do it?)
N / A(not a
System
Wide
Change)
*Contingency
deadline: N / A(not a
System
Wide
Change)
*Blocks
release? N / A(not a
System
Wide
Change)

In
the
case
the
Change is not completed, the
remainder
can
safely
be
deferred
until
Fedora
35.

Hi,

I
imported
a
new
package
called
voikko - fi
yesterday.I
think
I
hit
a
bug in fedpkg, but
I &  # 39;m not sure. The packaging guidelines say &quot;Any
detached
signature
file(e.g.foo.tar.gz.asc or foo.tar.gz.sig)
must
be
uploaded
to
the
package
lookaside
cache
alongside
the
source
code,
while the keyring must be committed directly to the package SCM.& quot;

I
think
fedpkg
import did

this
the
other
way
around.The
keyring
(called gpgkey-AC5D65F10C8596D7E2DAE2633D309B604AE3942E.gpg)
was
uploaded
to
the
lookaside
cache.The
signature
file(called
voikko - fi - 2.4.tar.gz.asc) was
about
to
be
committed
to
git.I
fixed
things
manually as much as I
could.

I
don &  # 39;t have the shell history available anymore and I may have made
an
error
somewhere
myself.I
have
not looked
at
the
fedpkg
source
code
yet, it &  # 39;d be interesting to know how to test the import again without
breaking
anything.

Hi,

This is a
re - review
for a rename and going from arch-specific to
noarch: < a
href = "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919688"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // bugzilla.redhat.com / show_bug.cgi?id = 1919688 < / a >

The
arch - noarch
stuff
was
discussed
here:
< a
href = "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/JSEYB5XU24HEX7BR2QVJ732MR5P52YJ6/"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // lists.fedoraproject.org / archives / list / devel @ lists.fedoraproject.o... < / a >

Voikko
4.3, which is needed
to
build
this, is not yet in Rawhide.I &  # 39;ll
push
it as soon as someone
commits
to
working
on
this
review.Pushing
Voikko
4.3
to
Rawhide
will
break
Finnish
spell - checking
until
this
package is in Rawhide as well.

The
best
packages
for me to review would probably be autotools-based
C / C + + stuff and Python
stuff.I
usually
have
time
for Fedora work only
during
weekends.

If
not, that &  # 39;s fine too -- but can we at least get a clear statement that Xen@Fedoras&#39;s not going to be maintained, so we can make other arrangements?

"""Tokenization help for Python programs.

tokenize(readline) is a generator that breaks a stream of bytes into
Python tokens.  It decodes the bytes according to PEP-0263 for
determining source file encoding.

It accepts a readline-like method which is called repeatedly to get the
next line of input (or b"" for EOF).  It generates 5-tuples with these
members:

    the token type (see token.py)
    the token (a string)
    the starting (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the ending (row, column) indices of the token (a 2-tuple of ints)
    the original line (string)

It is designed to match the working of the Python tokenizer exactly, except
that it produces COMMENT tokens for comments and gives type OP for all
operators.  Additionally, all token lists start with an ENCODING token
which tells you which encoding was used to decode the bytes stream.

Hi,

As
discussed
few
weeks
ago, I &  # 39;m working on reproducible builds for Fedora. I&#39;ve submitted a request for review for new packages: <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1924918" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1924918</a>. Notably, reprotest is a striking tool to test reproduciblity by changing multiples build factors (time, user, lang, etc.) and highlight differences (if exists) with diffoscope (see <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reprotest" rel="nofollow">https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reprotest</a>).

On
the
same
topic, I &  # 39;m developing rpmreproduce (see <a href="https://github.com/fepitre/rpmreproduce" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/fepitre/rpmreproduce</a>) which is very much work in progress. This tool allows to rebuild a RPM with the same environment, packages versions etc. This is in the continuity of a previous attempt <a href="https://github.com/kholia/ReproducibleBuilds" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kholia/ReproducibleBuilds</a>. Currently, it uses a &quot;buildinfo&quot; file as input (see <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/BuildinfoFiles" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/BuildinfoFiles</a>) but there is not such file in Fedora (yet?). In Qubes OS, we use an original implementation for RPM done at the occasion of Reproducible Builds summit: <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder-rpm/blob/master/scripts/rpmbuildinfo" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder-rpm/blob/master/scripts/rpmbuild...</a> or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fepitre/rpmreproduce/master/scripts/rpmbuildinfo" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fepitre/rpmreproduce/master/scripts/rpm...</a> (latest dev/test version). This tool is in charge to download exact version dependencies as specified in the buildinfo, create a local repository, download the corresponding source RPM and then, rebuild it with mock and only this locally created repository that reflects the original build environment.

I
take
this
opportunity
to
invite
RPM
devs
to
discuss
about
a
possible
upstream
implementation
of
buildinfo
file
format.For
example, we
could
think
about
having
a
buildinfo
file
automatically
generated
by
rpmbuild as dpkg is doing
similarly in Debian.I
would
be
happy
to
do
the
work
for that.

Best
regards,
Frédéric

Jami, Briar, P2P, etc
through
telepathy?

In
reSIProcate, we
did
some
experiments
with telepathy - qt to use GNOME
Empathy as front - end.It
rests
unfinished[1]
for anybody who wants to
learn
the
API.

Could
a
similar
approach
be
used
for some of the P2P messengers like
Jami and Briar?  As
our
reSIProcate
attempt is still in such
a
trivial
form, it
may
be
a
useful
skeleton
to
start
with.

This
could
help
work
around
the
Electron and ffmpeg
issues
discussed in
the
Jami
thread.

Incidentally, we
also
have
some
P2P
SIP / RELOAD in the
reSIProcate
stack, it is also
an
opportunity
for somebody.

Regards,

Daniel

cqrlog is failing

with lazarus:

But
the

It

Beware: Querying

Hi
everybody,

Since
the
last
pagure
version
was
deployed, the
API
for querying a
    group &  # 39;s packages (api/0/group/foo?projects=true) was broken - it is
now
paginated, where
before
it
was
not:

< a
href = "https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/5110"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // pagure.io / pagure / issue / 5110 < / a >

Note
that
it
does
not
return any
error
code, but
instead
just
gives
only
the
first
20
results
instead
of
all
of
them.

Additionally, the
paginated
query is currently
broken, querying
pages
2 and later
returns
zero
results:

< a
href = "https://pagure.io/pagure/issue/5111"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // pagure.io / pagure / issue / 5111 < / a >

This is hopefully
fixed
quickly, as it is now
impossible
to
query
pagure
for a group &  # 39;s packages / projects via the API.

otp / other cases in stg
* Their also doing a cleanup of a bunch of broken links on koji volume
* Mass rebuild of rpms is done, modules are underway
* FTBFS for the mass rebuild are filled

### CPE ARC TEAM
(Community Platform Engineering Advanced Reconnaissance Team....Team)
We have a new sub team in our team, led by Pingou, who are running
advance investigations on some of the tech debt and bigger initiatives
that the CPE team have in our backlog and they have been tackling
Datanomer / Datagrepper tech debt first.
The team have been partitioning the ‘messages’ table of datagrepper &  # 39;s
DB, & amp; hope to be able to test this setup next week
* prod like in openshift

Fedora migration is complete, the CentOS accounts will be then
imported.
* NOTE: If
you
have
an
account in both
CentOS & amp;
Fedora and have
different
email
addresses

## Team Info
### Background:
The
Community
Platform
Engineering
group, or CPE
for short, is the Red
Hat team combining IT and release engineering from Fedora and CentOS.
Our goal is to keep core servers and services running and maintained,
build releases, and other strategic tasks that need more dedicated
time than volunteers can give.

Grub2
patches in Fedora
< / a >

Hi,

What is the
vision
for grub2 package in Fedora versus upstream grub? The
huge
amount
of
patches in Fedora &  # 39;s grub (279 at this time) makes it
basically
a
fork.And
indeed
many
parts
are
incompatible
with upstream
    grub, like & quot;
    increment & quot;
    module, or BLS, just
    to
    name
    a
    few.I
    know
    it &  # 39;s
problematic
when
you
run
Fedora
VM
on
non - fedora
Xen
host if you
use
pvgrub / pygrub - in that
case
it
uses
host &  # 39;s grub to parse guest grub.cfg
and load
the
actual
kernel.But
I &  # 39;m pretty sure there are other
problematic
cases
too.

Is
there
any
specific
reason
why
those
patches
are
not upstream, or just
nobody
had
time
to
do
it? If
the
latter, can
I
help
with this somehow?

== Summary ==

RPM
Copy
on
Write
provides
a
better
experience
for Fedora Users as it
reduces
the
amount
of
I / O and offsets
CPU
cost
of
package
decompression.RPM
Copy
on
Write
uses
reflinking
capabilities in
btrfs, which is the
default
filesystem in Fedora
33.

== Detailed
description ==

Installing and upgrading
software
packages is a
standard
part
of
managing
the
lifecycle
of
any
operating
system.For
the
entire
lifecycle
of
Fedora, all
software is packaged and distributed
using
the
RPM
file
fomat.This
proposal
changes
how
software is downloaded
and installed, leaving
the
distribution
process
unmodified.

== = Current
process == =

# Resolve packaging request into a list of packages and operations
# Download and verify new packages
# Install and/or upgrade packages sequentially using RPM files,
decompressing, and writing
a
copy
of
the
new
files
to
storage.

== = New
process == =

# Resolve packaging request into a list of packages and operations
# Download and &#39;&#39;&#39;decompress&#39;&#39;&#39; packages into a &#39;&#39;&#39;locally optimized&#39;&#39;&#39; rpm file
# Install and/or upgrade packages sequentially using RPM files, using
&  # 39;&#39;&#39;reference linking&#39;&#39;&#39; (reflinking) to reuse data already on disk.

The
outcome is intended
to
be
the
same, but
the
order
of
operations is
different.

# Decompression happens inline with download. This has a positive
effect
on
resource
usage: downloads
are
typically
limited
by
bandwidth.Decompression and writing
the
full
data
into
a
single
file
per
rpm is essentially
free.Additionally:
if there is more than one
download
at
a
time, a
multi - CPU
system
can
be
better
utilized.All
compression
types
supported in RPM
work
because
this
uses
the
rpm
I / O
functions.
# RPMs are cached on local storage between downloading and
installation
time as normal.This
allows
DNF
to
defer
actual
RPM
installation
to
when
all
the
RPM
are
available.This is unchanged.
# The file format for RPMs is different with Copy on Write. The
headers
are
identical, but
the
payload is different.There is also
a
footer.
## Files are converted (“transcoded”) locally during download using
& lt;
code & gt; / usr / bin / rpm2extents & lt; / code & gt;
(part of rpm codebase).The
format
is not intended
to
be “portable” - i.e.copying
the
files
from the

cache is not supported.
## Regular RPMs use a compressed .cpio based payload. In contrast,
extent
based
RPMs
contain
uncompressed
data
aligned
to
the
fundamental
page
size
of
the
architecture, e.g.
4
KiB
on
x86_64.This
alignment is
required
for & lt;code & gt;FICLONERANGE & lt; / code & gt; to work.Only files are
represented in the
payload, other
directory
entries
like
symlinks,
device
nodes
etc
are
constructed
entirely
from rpm header

information.
Files
are
referenced
by
their
digest, so
identical
files
are
de - duplicated.
## The footer currently has three sections
### Table of original (rpm) file digests, used to validate the
integrity
of
the
download in dnf.
### Table of digest ? offset used when actually installing files.
### Signature 8 bytes at the end of the file, used to differentiate
between
traditional
RPMs and extent
based.

== = Notes == =

# The headers are preserved bit for bit during transcoding. This
preserves
signatures.The
signatures
cover
the
main
header
blob, and
the
main
header
blob
ensures
the
integrity
of
data in two
ways:
## Each file with content has a digest. Originally this was md5, but
today
it’s
usually
sha256.In
normal
RPM
this is only
used
to
verify
the
integrity
of
files, e.g. & lt;
code & gt;
rpm - V & lt; / code & gt;.With
CoW
we
use
this
as a
content
key.
## There is/are one or two digests (&lt;code&gt;PAYLOADDIGEST&lt;/code&gt; and
& lt;
code & gt;
PAYLOADDIGESTALT & lt; / code & gt;) covering
the
payload
archive
(compressed
cpio).The
header
value is preserved, but
transcoded
RPMs
do
not preserve
the
original
structure
so
RPM’s
pre - installation
verification(controlled
by & lt;
code & gt; % _pkgverify_level & lt; / code & gt;
will
fail.
& lt;
code & gt;
dnf - plugin - cow & lt; / code & gt;
disables
this
check in dnf
because
it
verifies
the
whole
file
digest
which is captured
during
download / transcoding.The
second
one is likely
used
for delta rpm.
# This is untested, and possibly incompatible with delta RPM (drpm).
The
process
for reconstructing an rpm to install from a delta is
expensive
from both a

CPU and I / O
perspective,
while only providing
marginal
benefits
on
download
size.It is expected
that
having
delta
rpm
enabled(which is the
default) will
be
handled
gracefully.
# Disk space requirements are expected to be marginally higher than
before: all
new
packages or updates
will
consume
their
installed
size
before
installation
instead
of
about
half
their
size(regular
rpms
with payloads still cost space).
# &lt;code&gt;rpm-plugin-reflink&lt;/code&gt; will fall back to simple file
copying
when
the
destination
path is not on
the
same
filesystem / subvolume.A
common
example is & lt;
code & gt; / boot & lt; / code & gt; and / or
& lt;
code & gt; / boot / efi & lt; / code & gt;.
# The system will still work on other filesystem types, but will
&  # 39;&#39;always&#39;&#39; fall back to simple copying. This is expected to be
slightly
slower
than
not enabling
CoW
because
the
source
for copying
    will
    be
    the
    decompressed
    data.
# For systems that enable transparent filesystem compression: every
file
will
continue
to
be
decompressed
from the original

rpm, and then
transparently
re - compressed
by
the
filesystem.There is no
effective
change
here.There is a
future
project
to
investigate
alternate
distribution
mechanics
to
provide
parallel
versions
of
file
content
pre - compressed in a
filesystem
specific
format, reducing
both
CPU
costs and I / O.It is expected
that
this
will
result in slightly
higher
network
utilization
because
filesystem
compression is purposely
restricted
to
allow
random
I / O.
# Current implementation of &lt;code&gt;dnf-plugin-cow&lt;/code&gt; is in Python,
but
it
looks
possible
to
implement
this in & lt;
code & gt;
libdnf & lt; / code & gt;
instead
which
would
make
it
work in & lt;
code & gt;
packagekit & lt; / code & gt;.

== = Performance
Metrics == =

Ballpark
performance
difference is about
half
the
duration
for file
    download + install
    time.A
    lot
    of
    rpms
    are
    very
    small, so
    it’s
    difficult
to
see / measure.Larger
RPMs
give
much
clearer
signal.

== Benefit

Faster
package
installs and upgrades

== Scope ==

*Proposal
owners:
** Merge
changes
to
rpm, librepo
to
enable
capabilities
** Add
dnf - plugin - cow
to
available
packages
** Test
days
** Aid
with documentation
    *Other
    developers:
** rpm, librepo: review

== Upgrade / compatibility
impact ==

None, RPM
with CoW is not enabled by default.

Upgrades
with & lt;code & gt;keepcache & lt; / code & gt; in dnf.conf will be able to use
existing
packages, but
it
will
not convert
them.This
only
happens
at
download
time.

If
a
system is configured
to
keep
packages in the
cache
(& lt;code & gt;keepcache & lt; / code & gt; in & lt;code & gt;dnf.conf & lt; / code & gt;) and
& lt;
code & gt;
dnf - plugin - cow & lt; / code & gt; is removed
then
the
packages
will
be
unusable.Recommend & lt;
code & gt;
dnf
clean
packages & lt; / code & gt;
to
resolve
this.

== How
to
test ==

Enable
RPM
with CoW with

& lt;
pre & gt;$ sudo
dnf
install
dnf - plugin - cow
...
$ sudo
dnf
install
hello
...
$ hello
Hello, world! & lt; / pre & gt;
There
should
be
no
end
user
visible
changes, except timing.

== User
experience ==

No
anticipated
user
visible
changes in this
change
proposal.This
makes
the
feature
available, but
does
not enable
it
by
default.

== Dependencies ==

# A copy-on-write filesystem; this Change is primarily targeting
btrfs, but
RPM
with CoW should work with XFS as well (untested)
# Most package install paths and the dnf package cache on the same
filesystem / subvolume.
# &lt;code&gt;rpm&lt;/code&gt; with Copy on Write patch set:
< a
href = "https://github.com/malmond77/rpm/tree/cow"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / malmond77 / rpm / tree / cow < / a >
# &lt;code&gt;librepo&lt;/code&gt; with transcoding support:

< a
href = "https://github.com/facebookincubator/dnf-plugin-cow/"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / facebookincubator / dnf - plugin - cow / < / a >

== Contingency
plan ==

*Contingency
mechanism: will
not include
PR
patches if not merged
upstream, skip & lt;
code & gt;
dnf - plugin - cow & lt; / code & gt;
*Contingency
deadline: Final
freeze
*Blocks
release? No
*Blocks
product? No

== Documentation ==

Documentation
will
be
available
at
< a
href = "https://github.com/facebookincubator/dnf-plugin-cow"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / facebookincubator / dnf - plugin - cow < / a > in the
coming
weeks

== Release
Notes ==

RPM
with CoW is not enabled by default.To enable it:

& lt;
pre & gt;$ sudo
dnf
install
dnf - plugin - cow & lt; / pre & gt;

Greetings
everyone and thanks
for your patience with us today.

Here &  # 39;s the current status of the branch conversion change:
< a
href = "https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/GitRepos-master-to-main"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // fedoraproject.org / wiki / Changes / GitRepos - master - to - main < / a >

By
namespace:

rpms: complete. &  # 39;rawhide&#39; is now the default branch and
there &  # 39;s also a symref to &#39;main&#39;.

flatpaks: complete. &  # 39;stable&#39; is the default/only branch.

containers: complete. &  # 39;rawhide&#39; is default, &#39;main&#39; is a symref.

modules: We
converted
this
over, but
after
consulting
with fesco we
backed
it
out.modules
with &  # 39;master&#39; branches should still have them,
net
effect
here
should
be
0.

tests: We
converted
this
to
use &  # 39;rawhide&#39; and a &#39;main&#39; symref, but this
was
probibly
not desired, so
we
are
consulting
with fesco / test
    maintainers
    on
    the
    desired
    state.Will
    update
    it in the
    next
    day or so
to
the
desired
state.

You
will
want
to
re - clone
any
repos
you
have
that
have
changed, or pull
changes and switch
to
the
new
branch.

If
you
run
into
any
issues, please
file
a
ticket:
< a
href = "https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/new_issue"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // pagure.io / fedora - infrastructure / new_issue < / a >

Thanks,

Can
the
ELN
be
fixed
to
stop
doing
rebuild
like
this? Of
course
the
issue is not in rubygem - thin
but
the
issue is that
once
the
Ruby
side
tag
was
merged, ELN
did
not bothered
with build order and now there is
rubygem - eventmachine
which
was
built
against
Ruby
2.7
where is should
have
been
build
against
Ruby
3.0.I
can &  # 39;t rebuild it, because that would
require
release
bump in Fedora(I
don &  # 39;t want to do that, because Fedora
maintainers
should
not be
bothered
with ELN, right?).

I
think
that
ELN
should
try to follow the Rawhide build order.If it
can &  # 39;t do that, then it should wait for manual intervention.

I
think
that
ELN
should
have
done
gating or scratch
build and check if
the
dependencies
are
the
same as in Rawhide or something.

I
think
that
ELN
should
check
the
build
result
for dependency issue and
    stop
    blindly
    submitting
    builds.

Modify % cmake_install
behavior?
< / a >

Currently if in source
builds
are
set
to
true, % cmake_install
appends
a & quot;.& quot;
current
directory.

I &  # 39;m working on building Avidemux on RPM Fusion and it requires multiple
cmake
builds and fakeroot
installs
which
means
I
have
to
allow & quot; in source
builds & quot;
to
stop
the
new
behavior
even
though
I &  # 39;m manually performing
multiple
out - of - source
builds.

During % install
I
would
much
prefer
to
do
something
likes:
% cmake_install & lt;
dir1 & gt;
% cmake_install & lt;
dir2 & gt;
% cmake_install & lt;
dir3 & gt;
...

But
that &  # 39;s currently not possible because it assumes &quot;.&quot; is appropriate.
I &  # 39;d really rather not have to pushd into each directory as that&#39;s just ugly
:)

Is
there
a
way
to

Has
anybody
tested
the
Jami
softphone
from Savoir

-Faire
Linux?  It
was
formerly
known as Ring.

They
distribute
RPMs
directly
from the web

site[1].It is already[2] in
Debian
for some time.

They
distribute[3]
their
DHT as a
library, OpenDHT,
for use in other
    projects.

Regards,

Daniel

I
just
received
3
notifications
that

& gt;
the - new - hotness
saw
an
update
for & lt;package & gt;, but pkgdb says the maintainers are not interested in bugs being filed

but
all
packages
have
monitoring
enabled.

Did
something
break
with it? Maybe the branch name changes?

Hey
folks,

I
write
this
to
let
you
know
that
there
has
been
this
decoupled
container
performance
monitoring
toolkit
that
I
have
written
for Docker, which you can find here < a href="https://github.com/t0xic0der/supervisor-driver-service" rel="nofollow" > https://
    github.com / t0xic0der / supervisor - driver - service < / a > (the API service) and here < a
href = "https://github.com/t0xic0der/supervisor-frontend-service"
rel = "nofollow" > https: // github.com / t0xic0der / supervisor - frontend - service < / a > (the web frontend).I
am
proposing
a
Podman
counterpart
of
it
with improvements and bug fixes to it as a project to be developed to complement Podman by providing a monitoring tool with easier learning curve and effective usage.

Packaging
question: Rebuild
initramfs
after
adding
to
dracut.conf.d
< / a >
< / span >
< div >

by
Eric
Edens

< / div >

class ="expander collapsed hidden-tn hidden-xxs hidden-xs" style="color: #999" >


I &  # 39;m working on a package that adds a configuration to dracut.conf.d. [1] To rebuild initramfs, upstream&#39;s spec file calls `dracut --force` in `%post` . [2]

Questions:
- Is
it
recommended
that
the
RPM
updates
initramfs?
- If
so, what &  # 39;s the recommended method?

As
background, the
RPM
will
be
used in the
Google
Cloud
kickstart[3]
during
image
creation, but
it
will
also
be
used
to
allow
users
to
import existing

installations
to
run
on
Google
Cloud.

What
I &  # 39;ve done so far:
- Read

rel = "nofollow" > https: // docs.fedoraproject.org / en - US / packaging - guidelines / < / a >

Also
I &  # 39;m a bit confused about the difference between &quot;main&quot; and
& quot;
rawhide & quot;
- which
one
should
I
use
for development that happened on
the
old

It

Heads - up: dropping
Berkeley

Hey
all,

Just
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
F34 is about
to
be
branched, and that
we
originally
planned
to
phase
out
BDB
rpmdb
support
to
read - only in Fedora
34[1].

That &  # 39;s too close to comfort for me, and might be considered too late for
other
reasons
too.So
a
slight
change
of
plans, lets
postpone
this
to
F35, and handle
this
right
away
after
F34
has
been
branched.Rpm & gt;= 4.17
which is to
be
expected
later in F35
will
not *have * read - write
BDB
support
at
all, so
disabling
it
early
gives
folks
a
little
of
leeway
where
things
can
still
be
temporarily
reverted if something
unexpected
breaks.

Should
we
file
a
separate
system - wide
change
for this, or can we proceed
on
the
basis
that
this
was
already
accepted as a
part
of
the
sqlite
change[1]?

Hi,

the
testsuite
of
the
package
cxxtools
fails
on
armv7hl and i686.

In
cxxtools
there is a
tool in & quot;
tools / cxxtz & quot;, which
reads
the
tz
database
using
cxxtools::Tz.

For
some
reason
reading
the
offset
for Europe / Berlin on 2018-11-7 13:00: 06
leads
to
a
offset
of
0.89111
h
instead
of
exactly
1
h.This
happens
on
the
Fedora
Build
Server
for armv7hl and i686 architecture[1].

I
put in der
check
section
the
command & quot;
tools / cxxtz - z
Europe / Berlin &  # 39;2018-11-07 13:00:05&#39;&quot; so that it can be seen in the log file.

build.log
results
on
armv8hl and i686
